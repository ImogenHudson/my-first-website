                  <div class="half-width">
                    <p> I'm Imogen, a freelance web designer and developer with an eye for detail and a passion for beautiful digital design. My journey into tech started after more than a decade of working as an illustrator and designer. Already experienced in creating beautiful digital designs, I realised coding would give me the freedom and ability to provide clients with exciting creative solutions for their web needs.</p>

                  <div class="half-width">
                    <p> Having worked as a freelancer for most of my career, I understand the importance of an effective, impactful website to promote yourself or your business. When I first learned how to build a website, I was hooked on the creativity and freedom this gave me. My aim is to provide a personalised solution for your needs. I enjoy using my creative and organisation skills to build simple and effective websites which provide optimum user experience.</p>

                       <h3> Hand-Coded <br>HTML </h3>
                       <p> My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

                       <h3> Well-Organised <br>CSS </h3>
                       <p> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date with current best practices. </p>
